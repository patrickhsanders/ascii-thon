## Theme
Before computers had complex graphical user interfaces, there were still many cool computer games. Your task for today is to **create a game with only text**.

For iOS students you'll need to create a _Mac command line application_, for Android students you wont be able to use Android Studio (look into IntelliJ or Eclipse). 

For inspiration see: [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) or just [text-based games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)
